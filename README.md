# Conways-GameOfLife
This is my Conway's Game of Life program, complete with a GUI. It is implemented in Java using Java swing. The "Grow x10" and "Grow x25"
buttons should work fine even if you spam them.

Run GUI.java, enter your starting seed, press initialize, and watch life play out.

You can Google some cool starting seeds... cornell.edu has a few cool documents on it.
